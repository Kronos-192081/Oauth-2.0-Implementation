# Oauth-2.0-Implementation
• Implemented a Oauth 2.0 protocol based authorization system using NodeJS backend and PostgreSQL as database.

• The implementation uses the express-oauth-server library of npm.

• It also checks for the grants to a user and therefore controls the activities that a user can perform. Additionally, it also checks for expired tokens and removes them from the database.
